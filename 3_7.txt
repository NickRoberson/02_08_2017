We can modify the dictionary data structure by adding two fields to it. These are
maximum and minimum and they will store the running min and max words that are in
the dictionary.

We can modify the insert and delete functions like so:

  For insert we can check to see if the value is less than the running min or
  more than the running max. If so we update the necessary value stored.

  For delete we can check to see if the value deleted is the min or the max. If so
  then we choose the next smallest or next largest and update the value.

  This way both the insert and delete functions will still take O(log(n)) time,
  but now we are able to modify the max() and min() functions appropriately. 

This way when we go to call the min() and max() functions we can just return
these values stored in the dictionary. This will take O(1) time.
